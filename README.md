## 👩‍💻 Role  
As the **Data Analyst**, I was responsible for:  
- Collecting and preparing inventory & logistics datasets.  
- Performing exploratory and supply chain analytics.  
- Designing **interactive dashboards** in Power BI.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL** – Querying structured data.  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard design & data visualization.  
- **Excel** – Supporting calculations & preprocessing.  
- **DAX** – Creating calculated measures for KPIs.  

---

## 🔍 Process  

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Collected raw **inventory, orders, suppliers, and logistics data**.  
   - Handled missing values and ensured data integrity.  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Analyzed supply chain performance metrics: lead times, stock-outs, supplier delays.  
   - Segmented suppliers/customers by performance and risk factors.  

3. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Built dashboards with KPIs: **inventory turnover, order cycle times, delivery performance**.  
   - Added drilldowns to track **regional warehouses and supplier efficiency**.  

4. **Business Storytelling**  
   - Created executive-level views to support **operations and logistics teams**.  
   - Designed reports highlighting **bottlenecks and cost-saving opportunities**.  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Identified **delayed shipments** and suppliers with inconsistent delivery performance.  
- Highlighted **overstocked vs. understocked items** for better inventory control.  
- Found inefficiencies in **transportation routes** impacting costs.  

---

## 💼 Business Impact  
- Helped optimize **inventory turnover**, reducing holding costs.  
- Improved **supplier performance tracking** for better contract negotiations.  
- Enhanced **logistics planning**, cutting delays and operational inefficiencies.  

---

## ✅ Challenges & Learnings  
- Managed **data inconsistencies** across multiple sources.  
- Learned **supply chain KPIs** deeply (inventory turnover, OTIF – On Time In Full).  
- Strengthened **Power BI DAX modeling** for operational analytics.  

---

## 📈 Future Improvements  
- Integrate **real-time supply chain data feeds** (IoT, sensors).  
- Incorporate **predictive analytics** for demand forecasting.  
- Expand dashboards with **what-if analysis** for scenario planning.
